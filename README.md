# A unique take on Bookmarks, Tags and Notes

##  Now available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/braintool/fialfmcgpibjgdoeodaondepigiiddio)!

BrainTool is a Chrome extension that can be used as a unique bookmarks/tabs manager but which also synchronizes with a plain text emacs org-mode style file on your Google Drive to become a more all encompassing personal knowledge management tool.

The BrainTool side panel shows your nested tag hierarchy.

Type three or four characters to auto-complete and save a page. Add short or detailed notes to aid recall.

Open, Close and Control all pages by tag with a single click. Great for switching between tasks and projects and keeping your work-space clean.

Drag, drop and reorder the hierarchy at will. Mark pages as TODO/DONE, ToRead or create your own tags and process.

Close, Hide or Pop tagged pages to support different organizational workflows.

All your data is stored on your Google Drive in a plain text file that can be separately edited, backed-up or shared. Everything is kept securely within your Google ecosystem and nowhere else. Your BrainTool file is structured as an [org-mode](http://orgmode.org) file. The BrainTool panel in Chrome uses the org-mode tree structure but concentrates on the links within your notes thus unifying two primary ways to capture information.
