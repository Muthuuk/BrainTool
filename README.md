# BrainTool
BrainTool is a Chrome extension that can be used as a unique standalone hierarchical bookmarks manager but which also synchronizes with a plain text emacs org-mode style file on your Google Drive. The BrainTool panel in Chrome uses the org-mode tree structure but concentrates on the links within your notes thus unifying, at least for me, the two main ways I capture information.

Currently it is at a minimal MVP-for-me level of functionality so I have not published it. If you want to try it clone the extension folder and create it as a local extension:
- open [chrome://extensions]
- toggle developer mode on
- click the "Load unpacked" button and point to the extension code location
- the extension now shows as an icon in your tool bar
- click the icon!

There's more info in the [Overview](http://braintool.org/overview) (which won't use my Jekyll style for some unknown  reason). Let me know if you have any thoughts, comments, or feedback.
