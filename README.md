# A Better Way to Manage Tabs, Links and Notes

BrainTool is a Chrome extension that can be used as a unique bookmarks/tabs manager but which also synchronizes with a plain text emacs org-mode style file on your Google Drive to become a more all encompassing personal knowledge management tool.

The BrainTool panel in Chrome uses the org-mode tree structure but concentrates on the links within your notes thus unifying two primary ways to capture information.

Currently it works for my workflow and is at a general MVP level of functionality. It is published to the Chrome Extension store but unlisted. I'd love comments from a handful of early adopters.

If you want to try it ping me at braintool.extension@gmail.com

There's more info in the [Overview](http://braintool.org/overview) and the required official privacy policy is [here](./BrainToolPrivacyPolicy.pdf). Let me know if you have any thoughts, comments, or feedback [braintool.extension@gmail.com](mailto:braintool.extension@gmail.com).
