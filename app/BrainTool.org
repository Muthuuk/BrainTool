Follow these steps to get up and running quickly.
** TODO Review the Topic Hierarchy
BrainTool is organized as a hierarchy of topics. 
The structure is yours to define, this is just an example.
** TODO Import Bookmarks
Open the Options/Actions menu (top left) and click Import Bookmarks. 
** TODO Organize your Topics
- Now is a good time to define your personal set of topics and organize your imported links. 
- Discard liberally! 
- No need to do it all at once, just leave this TODO open to remind you.
** TODO Close out your tabs
With BrainTool you need fewer tabs open. Use the BrainTool Bookmarker to file tabs away into BT where you can find them again.
** TODO Now use the tool!
- Keep the Topic Manager open while you work.
- File stuff away liberally.
- Experiment with different workflows (eg 'Finish Today' or 'Next Action' topics).
- Re-organize your topic tree as it evolves.

* Project
Keep all your links and notes for each project in one place. Expand these example projects to see sample sub topics.
