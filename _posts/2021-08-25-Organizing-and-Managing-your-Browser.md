# Organizing and Managing your Browser: <br/>Tabs and Topics in BrainTool

## Why you need BrainTool
You already know why! 

- You have hundreds of web sites and pages and apps that you visit regularly in a browser.
- You keep dozens of tabs open and spend too much time finding the one you want. 
- You have no good way to keep track of all your online stuff.
- You're afraid to close a tab when you leave it because you'll be coming back at some point and you'd have to put too much thought into saving it somewhere. 

You've long since given up on your disorganized bookmarks. You've tried pinned tabs and tab groups and vertical tabs. They help, a little bit.

**You need a better way to work in your browser.**

## What BrainTool is
BrainTool is a [Topic Manager]({% post_url 2021-05-15-Organizing-your-life-with-a-Topic-Manager%}). A Topic is a category, or grouping of any kind, that you can assign to a tab - anything from "Ideas for living room curtains" to "BrainTool Admin Pages". Topics can branch into subtopics and sub-subtopics of any depth (e.g. Projects&#8594;BrainTool&#8594;Admin Pages&#8594;etc).

BrainTool is also an extension that sits inside your browser and helps you keep track of all your topics and to work more efficiently.
<br/><br/>
The BrainTool Popup makes it easy to assign a topic to a web page, with a note capturing why its important.
<br/><br/>
The SidePanel holds the topic hierarchy for you to edit and curate. It lets you open and close topics en masse and navigate the pages you've associated with a topic.

All the tabs visiting a topic are grouped within a visible tab group or a separate window to keep them organized and together.

## How you should use BrainTool
Import and organize your existing bookmarks. Or just start categorizing your open tabs via the Popup. (Then you can finally close them out!)

Work proactively by creating a topic before you start a new piece of research. Or re-actively by considering what to do with each tab as you leave it: assign a topic and close, update its note, close and forget, or keep it open as part of your current working tabs.

Keep active notes on topics and their associated pages to build out your personal information space. Assign a TODO state to any topic or page to track a task.

BrainTool comes with an initial example set of topics and a proposed organizational structure. You can use it as is, modify it, or scrap it and build your own.

For improved focus get in the habit of working within a single topic, or small number of related topics, and being purposeful about context switching.

## What you should know
Your browsing data and associated topics and notes are your personal and private information. BrainTool is structured such that no one else has any access to your data. The tool running inside your browser uses local browser storage or a synced file that is solely under your control.

To further support efficient browser operation and in homage to its roots, BrainTool supports keyboard control - use 'h' from the side panel for the full list. _(See BT below, navigating the hierarchy and controlling vertical tabs in Edge.)_

WRT its roots, BrainTool originally came out of my attempt to unify my text notes and my bookmarks. I keep my text notes in [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org) syntax so that's how BrainTool stores your underlying information. You can sync to an Org file, keep your braintool data in there, and then use other tools to edit it also.
