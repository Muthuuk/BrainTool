# About BrainTool
In one way or other I've been working on BrainTool my whole life. It's an evolution of how I organize and manage my own [information space](https://informationspace.net). After a long career as a software developer and longer one as an architect and engineering manager I recognized that the time was right to build it as a product for general use. 

These days knowledge workers spend most of their time in a browser. Today's browsers are amazing tools, but they don't provide support for organizing and managing all of your online stuff. BrainTool provides that support. 

See the posts and essays [here](./posts) give more details and background.
