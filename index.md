# A Topic Manager for your Online Life


**Praise from users and the press:**
- "Bring your bookmarks into the 21st century...Every Google Chrome user should try this"
    - [Kingsley-Hughes @ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-google-chrome-user-should-try-this/)
- "As a current Tabs Outliner user, my first reaction is that BrainTool, even in its pre-1.0 release, is far more polished."
- "I've used Session Buddy and OneTab. This is far superior."
- "Behind the simplicity is a lot of power."
- "Gave bookmarks the performance and usability boost that I'd been waiting for all these years"

<h3>
You spend all your time working in a browser. But the browser doesn't support your workflow.
<br/><br/>
With BrainTool all your tools & online information sources are organized by Topic in the BrainTool side panel.
<br/><br/>
Open and close groups of tabs for a Topic with a click.
<br/><br/>
Context switch with ease and keep your workspace clean. Control everything with powerful keyboard commands.</h3>

# Plain Text for the Win!
- Your data is stored in a continuously synced plain text file.
- BrainTool uses structured [org-mode](http://orgmode.org) syntax.
- The file can be separately edited, backed-up or shared.
- You can import and export to and from bookmarks or org-mode files.
